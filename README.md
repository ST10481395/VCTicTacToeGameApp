**Game Setup**


•	**Players:** 

Two players take part in the game. One player uses the symbol X, while the other uses O.

**Grid:** 

The game is played on a 3x3 grid, which consists of nine squares.


**Objective**

The objective of the game is to be the first player to get three of their marks (either X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.


**Rules of Play**

1.	**Starting the Game:**
   	Players decide who goes first. The first player will use the X symbol, and the second player will use O.

3.	**Taking Turns:**
   
   
     Players take turns placing their symbols (X or O) in an empty square by clicking on the corresponding button on the grid.
  	     	When a player clicks on a square, their symbol replaces the button label, indicating that the square is occupied. 

6.	Winning the Game:
   
     After each turn, the game checks for a winning condition. A player wins if they:
  	
   Align three symbols in a row horizontally (e.g., A1, A2, A3).

   Align three symbols in a column vertically (e.g., A1, B1, C1).

   Align three symbols diagonally (e.g., A1, B2, C3).

If a player wins, a message is displayed to indicate the winner, and further moves are disabled.


7.	**Game Draw:**

If all nine squares are filled and neither player has achieved three in a row, the game ends in a draw. A message is displayed to indicate that the game is a tie.


8.	**Restarting the Game:**
   
       After a win or a draw, players can restart the game. This can typically be done by resetting the grid back to its initial state, allowing players to play again.


**Summary of Gameplay Steps**

1.	Player 1 (X) takes the first turn and places their mark on an empty square.
2.	Player 2 (O) takes their turn next, placing their mark in an available square.
3.	The game alternates turns between players until one player wins or all squares are filled, leading to a draw.
4.	If there is a winner, announce the winner; if it’s a draw, declare that as well.
5.	Allow players to restart the game if they wish to play again.
